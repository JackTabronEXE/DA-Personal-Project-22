          <p>Kia ora I'm Jack, recent dev graduate and former brand manager/marketeer turned developer. I used to work with a lot of data science and opted to learn Python during lockdown,
           with a love of problem solving and some research I ended up here! <br></br>
					<br></br>
						My passion lies in driving fun and unique user experiences, Im perpetually seeking inspiration by awesome companies 
						developing complex yet approachable products for any demographic or audience.
						Currently my focus is on learning and practising my skills (& having fun while doing it!) in addition to building apps 
						that create long term user relationships and loyalty for years to come. <br></br>
						<br></br>
						I'm always interested in collaborating with others in my spare time, in addition to challenging myself to learn new tech of course! </p>
